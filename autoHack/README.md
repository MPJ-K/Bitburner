# README
This was my first hacking script. It's pretty dumb, no batching or anything fancy like that, but it worked fine in the early game.  
It takes heavy inspiration from some other scripts, but all the code was written by me.

Requires the three helper scripts `weakenOnce.js`, `hackOnce.js` and `growOnce.js` to be stored in the same folder as this script.
