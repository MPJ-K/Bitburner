This is one of my favorite projects!

Managing augmentations in Bitburner can be quite annoying.
For example, it is more efficient to buy the most expensive augmentations first because the price increases after every purchased augmentation.
This script makes finding the right purchase order very simple.
Another great use is determining which factions are needed to obtain augmentations that provide a desired bonus.

You can search through most augmentations in the game using various filters and sort them by cost or reputation cost.
If you have access to singularity functions, you can also sort out augmentations you already own.
Some more information related to properly using the script is found inside `augViewer.js`.

There is still some room for improvement, but the existing functionality is already very useful. Feel free to try it out!
