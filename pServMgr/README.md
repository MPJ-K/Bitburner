# README
This script simplifies the purchasing and managing of player owned servers.  
It handles automatic purchasing or removal in the desired amount and/or RAM configuration and assigns informative server names.  
You can interact with it through the prompts it puts out and the information printed to the terminal.  
It requires the helper script `pServerAutoPurchase` to work properly.

This is one of my earlier scripts and therefore it may be a bit messy.
